TrelloFix

TrelloFix is a small Chrome extension that fixes some visual issues I'm having with Trello.

Main features:
* Marginally smaller, but easier to read, font-face.
* Card ID clearly visible on card.
* Card counter in the list header.
* Aligned, faded and framed card badges for easier identification.
* Aligned and reduced user images on cards.
* Wider description area.
* Increased readability for card descriptions.
* Cleaner activity logs.
* Highlighted pull requests in comments for easy access.
* ... and a lot of other small ui tweaks.
